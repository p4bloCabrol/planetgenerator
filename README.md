# 🪐 Planet Generator

**Planet Generator** is a creative tool that procedurally generates fictional planets, including physical characteristics, classification, and bits of lore. Built with React, it's designed to be both a technical showcase and a sandbox for storytelling.

## ✨ Features

- Random planet name generation
- Classification: rocky, gaseous, aquatic, volcanic
- Planet stats: gravity, temperature, life support
- Short auto-generated descriptions for worldbuilding
- Clean, responsive UI for presentation
- Built with React + TypeScript

## 🎯 Why this project?

Instead of building yet another to-do list or e-commerce cart, this project explores how code can support imagination, fiction, and interactive storytelling. It’s an attempt to combine frontend development with sci-fi worldbuilding.
